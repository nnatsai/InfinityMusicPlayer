For Hack GT, my group and I decided to do Godlman Sach's UX design competition, which was to create the interface of any kind of app. To expand further on our UX design skills, my team mate Japhet Ndemera and I decided to recreate Pandora and Spotify in an Android Music app we named Infinity. Our goal was to creat a beautiful app that was also easy to use. The name Infinity was inspired by the parralax layout, which we used for out home page.

The basic color scheme for the app was black and white, which was contrasted by images from the app. We wanted to create a versity simple and clean layout which was also visually pleasing.

To decide upon the layout of the app, we conducted research at the Hackathon, by getting user feedback from other students at the hackathon. This was perfect for us, because our targeted audience was college students.
